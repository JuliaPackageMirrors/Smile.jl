## Credit

The Decision Systems Laboratory asks that all publications of research in which SMILE is used contain an explicit acknowledgement to that effect. A simple example is: "The models described in this paper were created using the
SMILE reasoning engine for graphical probabilisitc models developed by the Decision Systems Laboratory at the University of Pittsburgh and available at http://genie.sis.pitt.edu/."
